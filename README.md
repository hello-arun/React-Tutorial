# React-Tutorial

First of all we need node and node-package-manager(npm). 

## Install create-react-app
By using `create-react-app` we can initialize empty react app instantly for development.
```
npm i -g create-react-app
```

## Create an empty react app
We can use `create-react-app` to initilize empty react app
```
create-react-app react-app
```
This will create the folder `react-app` with all the depenedencies installed inside it. Actually this folder is the react application folder. We do all of out code inside this folder. 

You are now in `Chap-50-Counter-App-events` branch. Go to [react-app](./react-app/) folder for tutorial.

If you have completed `Chap-50` switch to `Chap-60` for next tutorial.
