# React App

***To see how this react-app was initiated go to [README.md](../README.md)***

## File and Folder Structure

File and folder structures are discussed in detail in `Chapter 10`. Switch to that branch to read more...

## Scratching the surface

we have deleted everything for the `src` folder and created `index.js` file to start from the scratch. Just read `index.js` and see how the DOM manipulation is performed in React. If you have some experiance with javascript then it is easy to realize that how easy it is in REACT. 

Also the element declaration is in jsx which stands for java script extension. To see the old javascript equivalent code you can go to https://babeljs.io/repl .
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1> // This is jsx expression
```

## How to run

To Runs the app in the development mode.\

```bash
cd react-app
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## How to build

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Switch to `Chap-30` for next chapter. We will now make an complete counter-app.
